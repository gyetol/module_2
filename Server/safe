       This  system  call  performs  control operations on the eeppoollll(7) instance referred to by the file descriptor _e_p_f_d.  It requests that the operation _o_p be performed for the target
       file descriptor, _f_d.

       Valid values for the _o_p argument are:

       EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__AADDDD
              Register the target file descriptor _f_d on the eeppoollll instance referred to by the file descriptor _e_p_f_d and associate the event _e_v_e_n_t with the internal file linked to _f_d.

       EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__MMOODD
              Change the event _e_v_e_n_t associated with the target file descriptor _f_d.

       EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__DDEELL
              Remove (deregister) the target file descriptor _f_d from the eeppoollll instance referred to by _e_p_f_d.  The _e_v_e_n_t is ignored and can be NULL (but see BUGS below).

       The _e_v_e_n_t argument describes the object linked to the file descriptor _f_d.  The _s_t_r_u_c_t _e_p_o_l_l___e_v_e_n_t is defined as:

           typedef union epoll_data {
               void        *ptr;
               int          fd;
               uint32_t     u32;
               uint64_t     u64;
           } epoll_data_t;

           struct epoll_event {
               uint32_t     events;      /* Epoll events */
               epoll_data_t data;        /* User data variable */
           };

       The _e_v_e_n_t_s member is a bit mask composed by ORing together zero or more of the following available event types:

       EEPPOOLLLLIINN
              The associated file is available for rreeaadd(2) operations.

       EEPPOOLLLLOOUUTT
              The associated file is available for wwrriittee(2) operations.

       EEPPOOLLLLRRDDHHUUPP (since Linux 2.6.17)
              Stream socket peer closed connection, or shut down writing half of connection.  (This flag is especially useful for writing simple code to detect peer shutdown when using
              Edge Triggered monitoring.)

       EEPPOOLLLLPPRRII
              There is an exceptional condition on the file descriptor.  See the discussion of PPOOLLLLPPRRII in ppoollll(2).

       EEPPOOLLLLEERRRR
              Error  condition  happened  on  the associated file descriptor.  This event is also reported for the write end of a pipe when the read end has been closed.  eeppoollll__wwaaiitt(2)
              will always report for this event; it is not necessary to set it in _e_v_e_n_t_s.

       EEPPOOLLLLHHUUPP
              Hang up happened on the associated file descriptor.  eeppoollll__wwaaiitt(2) will always wait for this event; it is not necessary to set it in _e_v_e_n_t_s.

              Note that when reading from a channel such as a pipe or a stream socket, this event merely indicates that the peer closed its end of the channel.  Subsequent  reads  from
              the channel will return 0 (end of file) only after all outstanding data in the channel has been consumed.

       EEPPOOLLLLEETT
              Sets the Edge Triggered behavior for the associated file descriptor.  The default behavior for eeppoollll is Level Triggered.  See eeppoollll(7) for more detailed information about
              Edge and Level Triggered event distribution architectures.

       EEPPOOLLLLOONNEESSHHOOTT (since Linux 2.6.2)
              Sets the one-shot behavior for the associated file descriptor.  This means that after an event is pulled out with eeppoollll__wwaaiitt(2) the associated file descriptor  is  inter‐
              nally  disabled  and  no  other events will be reported by the eeppoollll interface.  The user must call eeppoollll__ccttll() with EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__MMOODD to rearm the file descriptor with a new
              event mask.

       EEPPOOLLLLWWAAKKEEUUPP (since Linux 3.5)
              If EEPPOOLLLLOONNEESSHHOOTT and EEPPOOLLLLEETT are clear and the process has the CCAAPP__BBLLOOCCKK__SSUUSSPPEENNDD capability, ensure that the system does not enter  "suspend"  or  "hibernate"  while  this
              event  is  pending  or  being processed.  The event is considered as being "processed" from the time when it is returned by a call to eeppoollll__wwaaiitt(2) until the next call to
              eeppoollll__wwaaiitt(2) on the same eeppoollll(7) file descriptor, the closure of that file descriptor, the removal of the event file descriptor with EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__DDEELL, or the  clearing  of
              EEPPOOLLLLWWAAKKEEUUPP for the event file descriptor with EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__MMOODD.  See also BUGS.

       EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE (since Linux 4.5)
              Sets  an exclusive wakeup mode for the epoll file descriptor that is being attached to the target file descriptor, _f_d.  When a wakeup event occurs and multiple epoll file
              descriptors are attached to the same target file using EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE, one or more of the epoll file descriptors will receive an event with eeppoollll__wwaaiitt(2).  The default in
              this scenario (when EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE is not set) is for all epoll file descriptors to receive an event.  EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE is thus useful for avoiding thundering herd problems
              in certain scenarios.

              If the same file descriptor is in multiple epoll instances, some with the EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE flag, and others without, then events will be provided  to  all  epoll  instances
              that did not specify EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE, and at least one of the epoll instances that did specify EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE.

              The  following  values may be specified in conjunction with EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE: EEPPOOLLLLIINN, EEPPOOLLLLOOUUTT, EEPPOOLLLLWWAAKKEEUUPP,, and EEPPOOLLLLEETT.  EEPPOOLLLLHHUUPP and EEPPOOLLLLEERRRR can also be specified, but
              this is not required: as usual, these events are always reported if they occur, regardless of whether they are specified in _e_v_e_n_t_s.  Attempts to specify other  values  in
              _e_v_e_n_t_s  yield  an  error.   EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE may be used only in an EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__AADDDD operation; attempts to employ it with EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__MMOODD yield an error.  If EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE has
              been set using eeppoollll__ccttll(), then a subsequent EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__MMOODD on the same _e_p_f_d, _f_d pair yields an error.  A call to eeppoollll__ccttll() that specifies EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE in _e_v_e_n_t_s  and
              specifies the target file descriptor _f_d as an epoll instance will likewise fail.  The error in all of these cases is EEIINNVVAALL.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       When successful, eeppoollll__ccttll() returns zero.  When an error occurs, eeppoollll__ccttll() returns -1 and _e_r_r_n_o is set appropriately.

EERRRROORRSS
       EEBBAADDFF  _e_p_f_d or _f_d is not a valid file descriptor.

       EEEEXXIISSTT _o_p was EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__AADDDD, and the supplied file descriptor _f_d is already registered with this epoll instance.

       EEIINNVVAALL _e_p_f_d is not an eeppoollll file descriptor, or _f_d is the same as _e_p_f_d, or the requested operation _o_p is not supported by this interface.

       EEIINNVVAALL An invalid event type was specified along with EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE in _e_v_e_n_t_s.

       EEIINNVVAALL _o_p was EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__MMOODD and _e_v_e_n_t_s included EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE.

       EEIINNVVAALL _o_p was EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__MMOODD and the EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE flag has previously been applied to this _e_p_f_d, _f_d pair.

       EEIINNVVAALL EEPPOOLLLLEEXXCCLLUUSSIIVVEE was specified in _e_v_e_n_t and _f_d refers to an epoll instance.

       EELLOOOOPP  _f_d refers to an epoll instance and this EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__AADDDD operation would result in a circular loop of epoll instances monitoring one another.

       EENNOOEENNTT _o_p was EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__MMOODD or EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__DDEELL, and _f_d is not registered with this epoll instance.

       EENNOOMMEEMM There was insufficient memory to handle the requested _o_p control operation.

       EENNOOSSPPCC The  limit  imposed  by  _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_f_s_/_e_p_o_l_l_/_m_a_x___u_s_e_r___w_a_t_c_h_e_s  was  encountered  while  trying to register (EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__AADDDD) a new file descriptor on an epoll instance.  See
              eeppoollll(7) for further details.

       EEPPEERRMM  The target file _f_d does not support eeppoollll.  This error can occur if _f_d refers to, for example, a regular file or a directory.

VVEERRSSIIOONNSS
       eeppoollll__ccttll() was added to the kernel in version 2.6.

CCOONNFFOORRMMIINNGG TTOO
       eeppoollll__ccttll() is Linux-specific.  Library support is provided in glibc starting with version 2.3.2.

NNOOTTEESS
       The eeppoollll interface supports all file descriptors that support ppoollll(2).

BBUUGGSS
       In kernel versions before 2.6.9, the EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__DDEELL operation required a non-null pointer in _e_v_e_n_t, even though this argument is ignored.  Since Linux 2.6.9, _e_v_e_n_t can be  speci‐
       fied as NULL when using EEPPOOLLLL__CCTTLL__DDEELL.  Applications that need to be portable to kernels before 2.6.9 should specify a non-null pointer in _e_v_e_n_t.

       If EEPPOOLLLLWWAAKKEEUUPP is specified in _f_l_a_g_s, but the caller does not have the CCAAPP__BBLLOOCCKK__SSUUSSPPEENNDD capability, then the EEPPOOLLLLWWAAKKEEUUPP flag is _s_i_l_e_n_t_l_y _i_g_n_o_r_e_d.  This unfortunate behavior is
       necessary because no validity checks were performed on the _f_l_a_g_s argument in the original implementation, and the addition of the EEPPOOLLLLWWAAKKEEUUPP with a check that caused  the  call
       to  fail  if the caller did not have the CCAAPP__BBLLOOCCKK__SSUUSSPPEENNDD capability caused a breakage in at least one existing user-space application that happened to randomly (and uselessly)
       specify this bit.  A robust application should therefore double check that it has the CCAAPP__BBLLOOCCKK__SSUUSSPPEENNDD capability if attempting to use the EEPPOOLLLLWWAAKKEEUUPP flag.
